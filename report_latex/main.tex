\section{Problem Statement}
In distributed systems, efficient collective communication (Broadcast and Gather) is crucial for performance. The objective of this project is to implement and analyze these operations on 2D and 3D mesh topologies. We aim to compare the performance of different routing algorithms and topology dimensions to understand their scalability and efficiency.

\section{Approach}

\subsection{Topologies}
We implemented a generalized mesh topology system using MPI:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2D Mesh:} Processes are arranged in a $\sqrt{P} \times \sqrt{P}$ grid.
    \item \textbf{3D Mesh:} Processes are arranged in a $\sqrt[3]{P} \times \sqrt[3]{P} \times \sqrt[3]{P}$ cube.
\end{itemize}
The 3D topology is expected to have a smaller network diameter ($3\sqrt[3]{P}$) compared to 2D ($2\sqrt{P}$), leading to lower latency.

\subsection{Algorithms}

\subsubsection{1. Dimension-Order Routing (DOR)}
This is a deterministic routing algorithm where messages are propagated along one dimension at a time.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Broadcast:} Root $\rightarrow$ X-axis $\rightarrow$ Y-axis $\rightarrow$ Z-axis.
    \item \textbf{Gather:} Z-axis $\rightarrow$ Y-axis $\rightarrow$ X-axis $\rightarrow$ Root.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pros:} Simple, deadlock-free, low message redundancy.
\textbf{Cons:} Higher latency (steps) compared to optimal flooding.

\subsubsection{2. Flooding (BFS)}
We implemented a flooding algorithm based on Breadth-First Search (BFS).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nodes send messages to all unvisited neighbors simultaneously.
    \item Propagation follows the "wavefront" or "diamond" pattern.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pros:} Optimal latency (steps = Manhattan distance).
\textbf{Cons:} High message complexity (redundant messages sent to shared neighbors).

\section{Implementation Details}
The project is implemented in Python using \texttt{mpi4py}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{mesh\_topology.py}: Handles coordinate mapping and neighbor discovery.
    \item \texttt{broadcast.py} / \texttt{gather.py}: Implements DOR algorithms.
    \item \texttt{flooding.py}: Implements BFS algorithms.
    \item \texttt{visualization/}: A web-based interactive visualization to demonstrate the message flow.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments & Results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform:} Local Linux environment with OpenMPI.
    \item \textbf{Processes:} Up to 16 processes.
    \item \textbf{Metrics:} Execution Time, Communication Steps, Total Messages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DOR vs Flooding Comparison}

\end{figure}

\subsection{2D vs 3D Comparison}
As predicted, the 3D topology reduces the number of communication steps compared to 2D, especially as the number of processes increases.

\section{Inferences & Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Topology Matters:} 3D meshes provide better latency characteristics than 2D meshes for large systems.
    \item \textbf{Algorithm Trade-off:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{DOR} is bandwidth-efficient (fewer messages) and simpler to implement.
        \item \textbf{Flooding} is latency-optimal (fewer steps) but consumes more bandwidth.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Visualization:} The interactive tool successfully demonstrates the different propagation patterns (Wavefront vs Axis-aligned).
\end{enumerate}

The project successfully implemented and analyzed the requested topologies and algorithms, confirming theoretical models through experimentation and visualization.
